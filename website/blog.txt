Our Cheating Partner Investigations
Because living in doubt is worse than knowing the truth.

At Insight Investigations, we specialise in one of the most emotionally difficult areas of
private investigation: cheating partners. If you suspect your partner is being unfaithful, you’re
not alone and you’re not wrong for wanting answers.
Infidelity is more common than most people realise. Research shows that around 22% of
men and 14% of women admit to cheating on a partner during a relationship. And those
figures only include the people who were willing to admit it. With dating apps, private
messaging, and social media making secrecy easier than ever, these numbers are likely
even higher.
But what’s worse than being cheated on?
Not knowing.
The suspicion. The constant guessing. The sleepless nights. Living in that fog of uncertainty
is exhausting, and it erodes your confidence and peace of mind.
That’s where we come in.
What We Do
Our investigations are tailored to your situation and carried out with complete discretion. You
don’t need to confront your partner or risk damaging your relationship further by snooping;
we handle it professionally, quietly, and legally.
We use proven techniques, including:
• Physical surveillance: Monitoring movements to confirm where they are and who
they’re with.
• Social media and dating app analysis: Searching for evidence of secret profiles or
online activity.
• Background checks: Investigating unexplained trips, unknown addresses, or
suspicious third parties.
• Neighbourhood and lifestyle inquiries: Gathering discreet intel when needed.
What You Get
You’ll receive a clear, evidence-based report of our findings, complete with photos or video
(where applicable). Whether we confirm infidelity or prove your suspicions wrong, you’ll gain
clarity, control, and peace of mind.
Because knowledge is power, and once you know the truth, you can decide your next move
with confidence.
